# Netflix-clone
This is a web application that mimics the interface and functionality of Netflix, allowing users to browse movies and TV shows, search for content, and watch trailers. The project was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. The UI was designed to closely resemble the original Netflix layout.
